# Docker-in-Docker DevContainer Template
## Introduction

Welcome to the Docker-in-Docker DevContainer Template! This project provides a fully configured development container for building Docker images within a Docker environment. It's ideal for developers looking for a consistent and isolated development environment for Docker, especially when working on multiple Docker projects.

## Features

- Docker-in-Docker: Run Docker inside a Docker container to ensure a clean, isolated development environment.
- Pre-configured Environment: Comes pre-configured with essential tools and settings, allowing you to focus on development rather than setup.
- Easy to Use: Simple setup process to get your development environment up and running quickly.

## Getting Started

# Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your machine.
- VSCode with the Remote - Containers extension installed (optional, but recommended for a seamless experience).

## Setup

- Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone https://github.com/pd-t/docker-devcontainer-template.git.
- Open in Container: If using VSCode, simply open the cloned directory in VSCode, and use the Remote - Containers extension to open the folder in a container.
- Build and Run: Use the Docker CLI within the devcontainer to build and run Docker images.

## Usage

After setting up the devcontainer, you can start developing your Docker images right away. The environment is isolated and mirrors the conditions of a standard Docker environment, ensuring consistency across different machines.
